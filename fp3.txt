This question touches on the deep intersection of symmetric functions (specifically Macdonald theory) and integrable stochastic processes like the **Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process (ASEP)**.

To answer directly: **Yes**, there exists such a Markov chain. It is constructed via the **multispecies TASEP (or ASEP)** on a ring or a line, often related to the **combinatorial formula of Cantini-de Gier-Wheeler**.

### 1. The Setup: Interpolation Polynomials at 

At the specialization , the interpolation Macdonald polynomials  and interpolation ASEP polynomials  simplify significantly. Specifically, when , the "interpolation" aspect relates to the **non-symmetric Macdonald polynomials** .

For a restricted partition  with distinct parts, the ratio



represents the stationary weight of a state  in a multispecies particle system.

### 2. Construction of the Markov Chain

The nontrivial Markov chain is the **multispecies ASEP (mASEP)** on a graph (typically a cycle  or a line with specific boundary conditions).

**The State Space:** The set  consists of all permutations of the parts of . Since  has distinct parts, these permutations correspond to different "species" of particles (e.g., a part of size  is a particle of type ).

**Transition Rules:**
Define the chain by local swaps of adjacent particles. For any two adjacent sites  and :

* If the particle at  is  and the particle at  is  (with ):
* They swap  with rate .
* They swap  with rate .



This is "nontrivial" because the transition rates depend only on the relative local order () and the parameter , not on the global values of the polynomials .

### 3. Proof Sketch of Stationary Distribution

To prove this chain has the desired stationary distribution, we use the **Yang-Baxter Equation** and the **Hecke algebra** action.

1. **Exchange Relations:** The interpolation polynomials  satisfy a recurrence relation via the **divided difference operators** (or Demazure-Lusztig operators) . Specifically:



where  (the specific form depends on the normalization).
2. **Global Balance Equations:** The condition for stationarity is . For the mASEP, this reduces to local "checked" equations:


3. **Specialization :** At , the  are known to satisfy the **R-matrix** relations of the  type. The ratio of  for adjacent species  exactly yields the -ratio required by the local MCMC transition rates.
4. **Normalization:** The denominator  is the symmetric version (the partition function), which ensures .

### Summary

The Markov chain is the **multispecies ASEP**. Its stationary weights are given by the specialized Macdonald polynomials because the local Markov move  is algebraically equivalent to the action of the Hecke generator  on the non-symmetric Macdonald basis.
