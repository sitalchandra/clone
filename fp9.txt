This problem explores the intersection of **multi-view geometry**, **invariant theory**, and **tensor recovery**. The tensors  are essentially generalizations of the **quadrifocal tensor** (specifically, they are "row-wise" determinants from four camera matrices).

The answer is **yes**, such a polynomial map  exists. The construction relies on the fact that the entries of  are multilinear forms in the rows of the matrices , and the scalars  act as a "gauge" transformation on the individual indices of the tensor collection.

### 1. The Geometry of the Relation

The entries  represent the determinant of a  matrix formed by selecting one row from each of four different  matrices. In computer vision, if these matrices were camera matrices, these determinants would be related to the **point-line-line-line** incidence relations.

The scaling  is a **cross-product of weights**. The condition  means that the ambiguity in the tensor collection is exactly the ambiguity of scaling the individual matrices (or their rows) independently.

### 2. The Polynomial Map : The Binomial Ideals

The map  is constructed from the **Toric Ideal** associated with the Segre embedding of the product of four projective spaces. To satisfy the property that  vanishes if and only if  is a rank-1 product of vectors, we look at **quadric relations** (determinantal equations).

Specifically, for any four indices sets , , , and , we can define relations based on ratios:



More generally, the "Fundamental Equations" of these tensors satisfy **cross-ratio-like identities**.

### 3. Construction of 

The map  consists of the following components:

* **Row-wise Binomials:** For fixed indices , the values  form a block. We define polynomials  that enforce:



This eliminates the entries of  (since they are generic and cancel out) and leaves only the relations on .
* **The "Tetrad" Relations:** Since , there is enough redundancy to ensure that the local  minor relations on  (which ensure the product form ) are globally consistent across the entire  lattice.
* **Independence of :** The degrees of these polynomials are consistently **2** (for binomials) or **4** (for more complex dependency cycles), satisfying the requirement that the degree does not depend on .

### 4. Proof Sketch of the "If and Only If"

* **If ():** If , then any binomial in  of the form  will see the  terms cancel out. Since  is constructed from these invariants, it vanishes.
* **Only If ():** This is a consequence of the **Fundamental Theorem of Projective Geometry** (or the characterization of rank-1 tensors). If the quadric minors of a multidimensional array vanish, and the array is sufficiently large ( for the array, here  ensures Zariski-genericity of the  entries), the array must be a tensor product of vectors. The "non-identical" constraint is a technicality to avoid the diagonal/self-interaction terms where the  values might vanish for non-algebraic reasons.

### Summary

The map  is essentially the collection of **2-minors of various flattenings** of the scaled tensor collection, adjusted by the known generic values of . It captures the "purely rank-1" nature of the noise/scaling .

**Would you like me to write out the explicit binomial relation for a specific  sub-block of the indices?**
