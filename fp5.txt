This question moves into the realm of **equivariant stable homotopy theory**, specifically the structural properties of ** operads** and the **slice filtration** as developed by Hill, Hopkins, and Ravenel, and later generalized by Blumberg and Hill.

## 1. The Transfer System 

An **incomplete transfer system**  on a finite group  is a collection of subgroups pairs  such that , satisfying:

* **Reflexivity:**  for all .
* **Transitivity:** If  and , then .
* **Restriction:** If  and , then .
* **Conjugacy:** If , then  for all .

In the context of an ** operad**,  specifies which norm maps  exist in the associated algebra category.

## 2. Defining the -Slice Filtration

The standard slice filtration uses the set of representation spheres . For an incomplete transfer system , we restrict the "generating" objects to those permitted by the transfer system.

Let  be the set of -cells of the form  where the transfers allowed by  dictate the internal structure. However, a more robust definition for the **-slice filtration** defines the subcategory  as the thick coreflective subcategory of  generated by:



where  is the regular representation of . A spectrum  is **-slice ** if it lies in this localized category.

## 3. Characterization of -Slice Connectivity

The goal is to characterize when a connective -spectrum  is -connected in the -slice sense using **geometric fixed points** .

### The Theorem

A connective -spectrum  is -slice  if and only if for every subgroup :



*Note: This specific bound assumes the regular representation slice indexing. In the case of incomplete transfer systems, the condition is restricted to the subgroups  that are "active" in .*

### Sketch of Proof

**Forward Direction ():**

1. Assume . It suffices to check this for the generators .
2. The geometric fixed points  commute with indexed induction. For a generator ,  is non-trivial only if  is conjugate to a subgroup of .
3. Since , and the dimension of the fixed point set of the regular representation is , the connectivity of the resulting sphere is .
4. Given the smallest possible value for the regular representation dimension is 1 (when ), we obtain the lower bound related to .

**Backward Direction ():**

1. This uses the **Equivariant Postnikov Tower** and the connectivity of the maps into geometric fixed points.
2. One constructs  by cell attachment. If the geometric fixed points have the required connectivity, the "difference" between  and its slice approximations must vanish.
3. For incomplete transfer systems, one utilizes the fact that  is an -algebra. The norm maps  allowed by  force the fixed point spectra to satisfy higher connectivity constraints precisely at the subgroups defined in the transfer system.
4. By the induction on the order of the group (the standard HHR method), the connectivity of  ensures that the maps from the -slice generators cover all the homotopy groups of .

### Summary of Connectivity

The "Slice Theorem" essentially states that the slice filtration is a way to "distribute" the dimension of a spectrum across its geometric fixed points, weighted by the order of the subgroups.

**Would you like to see how the definition of the slice changes if the  operad is the "trivial" operad (no transfers) versus the  operad (all transfers)?**
