The answer to this question is **no**. Not every polyhedral Lagrangian surface  with 4-faces meeting at every vertex admits a Lagrangian smoothing.

The existence of a smoothing depends on a delicate local-to-global obstruction theory involving the **Maslov class** and the specific geometry of the "links" at each vertex.

### 1. The Local Geometry: The Link at the Vertex

In a polyhedral complex , the neighborhood of a vertex  can be modeled as a **Lagrangian cone**. The intersection of this cone with a small 3-sphere  defines a link, which is a collection of curves (circles) on the Lagrangian Grassmannian or, more geometrically, a configuration of Legendrian curves in .

When 4 Lagrangian faces meet at a vertex, the link consists of 4 arcs. For a smoothing to exist, there must be a local Lagrangian "handlebody" or a smoothing of the Lagrangian singularity that preserves the Lagrangian condition throughout the isotopy.

### 2. The Obstruction: The Maslov Class and Area

A smooth Lagrangian surface  must satisfy the condition that the symplectic form  vanishes on it. A smoothing  must satisfy a consistency condition between the **Lagrangian angles** of the faces.

* **The Angle Criterion:** If we assign a Lagrangian angle  to each of the 4 faces meeting at a vertex, a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for the existence of a local smoothing is related to the **mean curvature flow** or the existence of a potential function.
* If the sum of the angles (properly oriented) across the vertex does not satisfy certain integrability conditions, the singularity is "rigid" in the Lagrangian sense, even if it is smoothable topologically.

### 3. Global vs. Local Smoothability

Even if every vertex of  is locally smoothable (i.e., there exists a local Lagrangian smoothing for each vertex neighborhood), there is a **global obstruction**.

1. **Hamiltonian Isotopy Constraint:** You specified the smoothing must be a Hamiltonian isotopy. This implies that the total symplectic area of any closed loop on the surface must remain constant (or zero).
2. **Monotonicity:** In many constructions of polyhedral Lagrangians (such as those by Matveyev or in the context of tropical geometry), the faces are forced to satisfy a "balance condition" (similar to the tropical balancing condition). If  is constructed such that it "wraps" around an obstruction in the symplectic manifold in a way that the Maslov class of the resulting smooth surface would be non-zero or inconsistent with the ambient space, no such  can exist.

### 4. Counterexamples in the Literature

Research into **Lagrangian Mean Curvature Flow (LMCF)** and **Hamiltonian stationary cones** has shown that certain configurations of Lagrangian planes meeting at a point are "isolated."

For a configuration of 4 planes (faces), if they do not satisfy the **Special Lagrangian** condition (a specific phase alignment), the singular point may be a "stable" singularity that cannot be perturbed into a smooth Lagrangian manifold without breaking the Lagrangian property or the Hamiltonian nature of the deformation.

### Summary

While the condition of having 4 faces at each vertex is the "generic" or "balanced" case for many polyhedral surfaces, it does not guarantee smoothability. The existence of a smoothing  requires:

* **Local integrability:** The link at the vertex must be a "null-cobordant" Legendrian.
* **Global consistency:** The Maslov classes and symplectic areas must align to allow for a global Hamiltonian deformation.

**Would you like to explore the specific "balancing condition" for vertices in tropical Lagrangian geometry, which serves as a precursor to these smoothing questions?**
