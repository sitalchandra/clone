This is a sophisticated question concerning the **local Rankin-Selberg integrals** for  and the existence of specific "test vectors" in the Whittaker model.

The answer is **yes**, such a  must exist. In fact, this is a core component of the theory of local -functions and the local functional equation developed by Jacquet, Piatetski-Shapiro, and Shalika.

### 1. The Context: Rankin-Selberg Integrals

The integral you've described is the local -functional  (here with a specific shift ). In the standard theory:

* The integral  converges for .
* It admits a meromorphic continuation to all .
* The collection of all such integrals forms a fractional ideal of  generated by the local -function .

### 2. Why the Property Holds

The property you are looking for—a vector  that makes the integral non-vanishing for **all** —relies on the **non-vanishing of the Whittaker functions at the identity** (or specific translated points) and the density of the Whittaker model.

Specifically, for any , we know that the local -function  has no zeros in the complex plane (it is of the form  where  is a polynomial with ). Therefore, if we can find  and  such that the integral matches the -function, it will be non-zero for all .

### 3. The Role of the Shift 

The element  is essentially a translation by the generator of the inverse conductor. In the context of the **Newform** theory (the work of Jacquet, Piatetski-Shapiro, and Shalika on essential vectors):

* There exists a unique (up to scaling) "essential vector" or **Newvector**  in the Whittaker model that is invariant under certain congruence subgroups related to the conductor.
* By choosing  to be a specific translation of the Newvector or by utilizing the fact that Whittaker functions can be chosen to have arbitrarily small support in the "big cell" of the mirabolic subgroup, one can force the integral to collapse to a single value at a point.

### 4. Direct Argument via Support

A more "brute force" way to see why such a  exists is as follows:

1. Whittaker functions  for  can be chosen to have compact support on  (after accounting for the character).
2. The space of Whittaker functions  contains functions with arbitrary compact support on the mirabolic subgroup .
3. By choosing  such that its support is extremely small and centered around the "shift"  relative to the support of , the integral effectively becomes a point evaluation of the Whittaker functions.
4. Since  is not identically zero, there exists a  such that . We then pick  such that  is non-zero and highly localized. This prevents any cancellations that would create zeros in .

### Summary

Because the local -function is the **GCD** of these integrals and is itself never zero, and because the Whittaker model is "large" enough to produce functions with specifically localized supports, there will always exist a  that ensures the integral is a non-zero constant (or a non-zero monomial in ), thereby avoiding zeros for all .
