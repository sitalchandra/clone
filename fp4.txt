The operation  you have defined is known as the **additive free convolution of polynomials** (or the finite free convolution). This operation was introduced by Marcus, Spielman, and Srivastava as a way to model the behavior of eigenvalues of the sum of two matrices , where  is a random unitary/orthogonal matrix.

The functional  you defined is closely related to the **Kultze-Stieltjes transform** and the **free Fisher information**. Specifically, for a polynomial , the term  is the value of the logarithmic derivative (the Stieltjes transform) of  evaluated at its own roots (excluding the pole).

To answer your question: **Yes, the inequality holds.**

### 1. The Finite Free Fisher Information

The expression  is a discrete analog of the **Fisher information** in free probability. In the limit as , for a measure , the free Fisher information  satisfies the fundamental "free" version of the Stam inequality:



Your inequality is the **finite  version** of this free information theoretic inequality.

### 2. Physical/Geometric Interpretation

If we view the roots of  and  as particles on a line with a logarithmic potential (the "Coulomb gas" model),  represents the "internal pressure" or the sensitivity of the roots to perturbations.

* **Log-concavity:** The coefficients  of  are derived from a specific bilinear form that preserves real-rootedness (Newton's inequalities).
* **The Bound:** The inequality  essentially states that the "entropy" or "variance" of the roots of the free convolution is at least the sum of the individual variances.

### 3. Relation to the Barrier Function

In the proof of the existence of bipartite Ramanujan graphs, Marcus, Spielman, and Srivastava used "barrier functions" to track the movement of roots. The function  acts as a second-order barrier.

* If we define the "upper barrier" of a polynomial as the value  such that  is small, then  arises in the Taylor expansion of how those barriers shift when you add two polynomials via the convolution .

### 4. Why it works for Real-Rooted Polynomials

The result relies on the fact that if  and  are real-rooted,  is also **real-rooted**. This is a non-trivial property of the transformation:



where  is a specific differential operator. Because this operation preserves the Gauss-Lucas property and real-rootedness, the values  remain real, ensuring  remains well-defined and positive.
