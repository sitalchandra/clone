The answer is **no**. If  is a uniform lattice in a real semi-simple Lie group and  contains 2-torsion, it cannot be the fundamental group of a compact manifold without boundary whose universal cover is acyclic over .

This result follows from a combination of the **Smith Fixed Point Theorem** and the relationship between the cohomology of a manifold and its fundamental group.

### 1. The Universal Cover and Eilenberg-MacLane Spaces

Suppose  is a compact manifold without boundary such that its universal cover  is acyclic over .

* If  is -acyclic, then  is a **rational Eilenberg-MacLane space** .
* This implies that the rational cohomology of the manifold is isomorphic to the rational group cohomology of the lattice: .
* Since  is a compact manifold of dimension  without boundary,  must satisfy **Poincaré Duality**. Crucially, this requires that the group  has finite **virtual cohomological dimension** (vcd) and behaves like a duality group.

### 2. The Torsion Problem

The existence of torsion in  creates a fundamental obstacle to  being a .

* **The Smith Fixed Point Theorem:** If a finite group  (in this case, the cyclic group  generated by the 2-torsion element) acts on a space  that is acyclic over , then the fixed point set  must also be acyclic over .
* Specifically, if  is -acyclic,  cannot be empty.
* **The Contradiction:** If  acts on  (the universal cover), and  is an element of order 2, then  must have a fixed point in  by Smith Theory.
* However, for a manifold , the action of the fundamental group  on its universal cover  must be **free** (properly discontinuous and without fixed points).

If  has a fixed point, the action is not free, and the quotient  is not a manifold, but rather an **orbifold**.

### 3. Semi-simple Lie Groups and the Borel-Serre Compactification

For a uniform lattice  in a semi-simple Lie group :

1. The natural space for  to act on is the symmetric space .
2.  is contractible (and thus -acyclic).
3. If  has torsion, it cannot act freely on .
4. Any other -acyclic space  that  acts on would be subject to the same Smith Fixed Point Theorem constraint.

### 4. Summary of the Argument

1. **Compact Manifold **   acts freely on .
2. ** is -acyclic** + ** has 2-torsion**  By Smith Theorem, there exists a fixed point for the torsion element.
3. **Fixed point exists**  The action is **not free**.
4. **Conclusion:** The initial assumption that  is a manifold is contradicted.  can only be the fundamental group of such a space if the action is free, which requires  to be **torsion-free**.
