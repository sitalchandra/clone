This is a fascinating question that sits at the intersection of spectral graph theory and the geometry of numbers, specifically relating to the **Kadison-Singer problem** and the **Weaver's  conjecture** (which was famously proven by Marcus, Spielman, and Srivastava).

The answer is **yes**, there exists such a constant . In fact, this is a consequence of the existence of **spectral sparsifiers** and specifically the "partition" version of the Marcus-Spielman-Srivastava (MSS) results.

### 1. The Condition: Spectral Dominance

The condition that  is positive semidefinite (PSD), denoted , means that for any vector :



In graph terms, the quadratic form  represents the energy of the signal , defined as . Your condition requires that the energy of the signal restricted to the edges within  is at most an -fraction of the total energy of the graph for *every possible* signal .

### 2. Connection to Weaver's Conjecture

To see why such a set  exists, we translate the Laplacian into its constituent vectors. Let , where  is the edge vector.
The condition  is equivalent to picking a subset of these vectors such that their sum is spectrally small compared to the total sum.

The MSS result (specifically the version regarding -partitions) implies that for any collection of vectors  that sum to the identity  (or any PSD matrix ), and satisfy certain "smallness" constraints (the leverage scores), there exists a partition of the indices into  sets  such that for each :


### 3. Sketch of the Existence Proof

The constant  can be derived by setting .

1. **Normalization:** Consider the edges as vectors in the semi-inner product space defined by the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse of the Laplacian.
2. **MSS Partition:** By the Marcus-Spielman-Srivastava theorem, for any graph, there exists a partition of the **edges** into  sets  such that the Laplacian of each edge-set .
3. **From Edges to Vertices:** The challenge in your prompt is finding an -light **subset of vertices** . However, if we take a random subset of vertices  where each vertex is included with probability , the expected number of edges in  is scaled by .
4. **The Constant:** Using the **method of interlacing polynomials** or specific concentration bounds for the eigenvalues of random sub-matrices (like those used in the restricted invertibility theorem), one can show that a subset  of size  exists where the edges induced by  satisfy the spectral bound.

### 4. Why it isn't "Trivial"

It is tempting to think a random set works. However, for a general graph (like a star graph), a random set might include the center vertex and several leaves, potentially violating the PSD condition if  is small. The existence of  relies on the fact that we can always find a set that avoids "concentrating" the spectral energy of the Laplacian, even in highly non-homogeneous graphs.

### Summary

The constant  is independent of the graph structure. It effectively arises from the fact that the "total" spectral weight of the graph is distributed such that no small set of vertices can capture more than its "fair share" of the energy, provided the set is chosen to respect the spectral geometry of .
